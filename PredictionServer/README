Solubility / Usability prediction server

For installing required packages use:
pip install -r requirements.txt

All models go into models/
Model name format: {PREDICTION_TYPE}_{MODEL_TYPE}_{Fold number 0-4}_quantized.onnx

Example Usage: 
python predict.py --FASTA_PATH ./test_fasta.fasta --OUTPUT_PATH ./test_preds.csv --MODEL_TYPE ESM12 --PREDICTION_TYPE S

For solubility PREDICTION_TYPE is S, for usability PREDICTION_TYPE is U and to output both together in the same file it is SU
MODEL_TYPE is Distilled or ESM12 or ESM1b or Both (ensemble prediction)

Recommended model is Distilled (NetSolP-D from the paper) since it has the best trade-off between speed and performance.
